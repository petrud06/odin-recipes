    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. </p>
            <p> Beat buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl.</p>
            <p>Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. </p>
            <p>You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; </p>
            <p>use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together.</p>
            <p>The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake.</p>
            <p>Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes;</p>
            <p>Flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side.</p>
            <p>Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
